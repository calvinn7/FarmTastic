2. To develop an algorithm to calculate the user's carbon footprint by the end of Week 2 of the project timeline.
3. To integrate real-time climate data and forecasted weather information by the end of  Week 4 of the project timeline.
4. To implement a farming calendar system for users to plan and track their progress by the end of Week 7 of the project timeline.


### üåç PROJECT SCOPE
#### Product Scope Description
FarmTastic, an e-farming mobile application, is meticulously crafted to equip agricultural practitioners with the wisdom and knowledge needed to embrace eco-conscious and sustainable farming techniques. The app will be a comprehensive platform that combines education, practical tools, and a supportive community to curtail the environmental impact of farming operations, optimize resource utilization, and fortify farming practices against the impacts of climate change.

#### üì¶ Deliverables
- A fully functional e-farming mobile app that is available for both Android users.
- A user-friendly registration process allowing users to create accounts, manage user profiles, and update personal information.
- A secure login system implemented with email/username and password-based user authentication.
- Data privacy and regulatory compliance with mechanisms for user consent and privacy controls.
- Carbon footprint calculator feature allowing farmers to calculate and track their carbon emissions related to farming activities.
- Personalized recommendations provided for reducing carbon emissions through changes in farming practices and carbon offsetting strategies.
- An interactive community platform designed for knowledge and experiences sharing related to sustainable and climate-friendly farming.
- Integration of real-time weather forecasts and climate data to provide farmers with localized and up-to-date information.
- Alerts and advisories given to protect crops and livestock from adverse weather conditions.
- Customization features allowing users to customize app settings, including notification preferences, measurement units, and display options, ensuring a user-centric experience.

#### ‚ùå Exclusions
- The app will not offer medical or healthcare advice. Users should consult healthcare professionals for any medical concerns or emergencies related to farming activities.
- The app will not directly engage in the sale of agricultural products. It will serve as an information and support platform rather than a marketplace.
- Personal financial or investment advice is not provided.
- Advertisements and endorsements are strictly prohibited to ensure it will remain as a neutral platform without favoring any particular entities.

#### üöß Constraints
- Farmers living in rural areas might have limited connectivity to access apps mainly focused on internet connection to spread information.
- Farmers with poor literacy skills in mobile apps might face the problem of using the app.
- Some functions of the app might require a higher version of the mobile device in order to enhance user experience.
- Climate change might affect the accuracy of data compatible with the weather forecast.
- The application may not provide time to time supervision on the real crops of the farmer because it only provides stimulation. Thus, problems like pest control and soil quality control could not be rectified.
- The application is a native application and it requires installation.
